# LaTeX Templates

This is a repository that will hold the blank LaTeX templates that I use

This is the BibLaTeX package I use for my ACS style citations: [link](https://www.ctan.org/pkg/biblatex-chem)

.gitignore: This contains all the files that TeXstudio generates when compiling a TeX document. Since they aren't important to the document itself, they don't need to be included in the version control.
